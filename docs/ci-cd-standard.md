# CI/CD standard — BrutalSystems npm packages

The CI/CD standard for BrutalSystems' Node/npm packages. muster, Tin Can and
birddog each keep their own copy and implement it independently — no repo
reads another's file, and no build here depends on a sibling being in step.

The copies will therefore diverge. That is a consequence of keeping the repos
independent, not a defect in it, and this file makes no claim to be identical
to any other. What it does instead is mark local facts where they occur, as
`> **Repository-specific, tincan.**`, so a reader can tell a deviation from
the shared standard without going to look at a sibling to find out.

No secrets, tokens, session IDs, or private paths belong in this file or in
the workflows it describes — each repo is public.

## Two workflows

Two per repository, same filenames everywhere:

| File | Trigger | Job |
|---|---|---|
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | push and PR to `main` | build, typecheck, test, tarball check |
| `.github/workflows/publish.yml` | push of a `v*.*.*` tag | release |

The filenames are part of the contract, not a preference: a trusted publisher
is registered against a specific workflow **filename**, so renaming the file
breaks publishing until the registration is redone.

**What `ci.yml` deliberately does not do:** no publish steps, and no
credentials of any kind — it has nothing to leak and nothing to misfire. It
does run the *same* tarball verification the publish job runs, from the same
script, so the two workflows cannot drift apart on what "verified" means. A
check that only the release runs is a check whose first real execution is the
one you cannot take back.

## Publishing uses OIDC, never a token

Releases authenticate with [npm trusted
publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers). The registry issues a
short-lived credential to the workflow run in exchange for GitHub's OIDC
identity.

**No `NPM_TOKEN` secret exists in any of these repositories.** Nothing to rotate,
nothing to expire unnoticed, nothing to leak from a public repo's secret
store. Provenance is generated as a consequence, so consumers can verify which
workflow run built the artifact.

This is also where npm is heading: it now refuses 2FA-bypassing granular
tokens for package configuration changes, and warns that it is restricting
them for direct publishing too.

The publish job declares:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write   # create the GitHub Release
  id-token: write   # OIDC: the npm credential itself, and provenance
environment: npm
```

`environment: npm` is **mandatory**. It is part of the trusted-publisher
identity, and it is where a required reviewer goes — which matters, because
OIDC widens publish rights from "whoever holds the token" to "whoever can push
a tag". npm says exactly that when trust is established: *"anyone with GitHub
repository write access can publish."*

### npm version floor

Trusted publishing needs npm >= 11.5.1, and Node 22 ships npm 10.x. Keep the
runner on the repository's `engines` floor and upgrade npm instead. Pinning a
newer Node on the publish runner also works, but then the artifact is built on
a runtime the package does not claim to support.

**Pin the npm version; do not use `npm@latest`.** The npm version does not
only clear the 11.5.1 floor — it also decides what `npm pack` puts in the
tarball, and npm's forced-inclusion rules are exactly where majors differ. A
file can ship under one npm and be omitted by another *on the same commit*,
so a repository running `npm@latest` in the publish job and whatever the
runner shipped in CI has two different packers and no way to predict which
answer it gets.

Declare it once per workflow and install exactly it, in **both** `ci.yml` and
`publish.yml`:

```yaml
env:
  NPM_VERSION: '12.0.2'
```

```yaml
- name: Pin npm
  run: |
    npm install -g npm@${{ env.NPM_VERSION }}
    npm -v
```

Install it **before** `npm ci`, so the lockfile is resolved by the same npm
that packs.

Three things make the pin hold rather than rot:

- **A test asserting the two workflows agree.** A half-bump is invisible
  otherwise — both files still parse and both still run, and the disagreement
  surfaces as a tarball that differs from the one CI verified. Assert too that
  each workflow installs the pin it declares, and that the pin has not dropped
  below 11.5.1.
- **Naming the supported version in RELEASING.md**, so a contributor packing
  locally knows which npm produces the tarball CI will accept.
- **Leaving the `engines`-floor matrix unpinned.** A repository whose CI proves
  a Node floor should keep exercising the npm that Node version actually ships;
  forcing the pin onto that leg tests a combination no user has.

The one-time `npm trust` setup below is a different question — that runs on a
person's own machine and wants a current npm, not the runner's pin.

## Fork guard

```yaml
if: github.repository == 'BrutalSystems/<repo>'
```

On the publish **job** itself, so a fork that pushes a tag gets no run at all.
OIDC would refuse it anyway — the registry trusts one repository — but an
explicit gate beats a confusing red run in somebody else's fork, and it costs
one line.

Its own heading, rather than a sentence inside the section below: this guard
belongs to the job, not to the sequence of checks, and folding it into another
section's preamble is how one copy came to carry the same paragraph twice for
months. A thing with its own heading is hard to duplicate by accident.

## Pipeline order

Cheapest checks first, so a bad release fails in seconds rather than after a
full install and test run. The fork guard above sits ahead of all of it.

1. **Tag matches `package.json`.** Fails the run. A published version is
   immutable, so shipping the wrong number is not recoverable.
2. **Release notes finalized**, if the repository keeps them. A repository
   with a `RELEASE_NOTES.md` extracts that version's section and fails if it
   is missing or still marked unreleased. A repository without one skips this
   and uses the tag annotation at step 12.
3. **Already published?** If the registry already serves this version, finish
   **green with nothing to do**. A re-pushed tag, or a release published by
   hand, is not an error. **This guard must never be hardened into a failing
   check** — step 1 is what catches a genuine mistake.
4. **Install, build, test** — `npm ci`, build, typecheck, the unit suite.
5. **Contract or integration suite**, where the repository has one — run
   against a real installed dependency, not against the unit tests' fakes.
6. **Pack** — `npm pack`.
7. **Verify the tarball** — `node scripts/verify-tarball.mjs`, see below.
8. **Smoke-test that exact tarball.** Install it into an empty temp prefix and
   run the binary. Nothing else in the pipeline notices a broken `bin`, a
   missing `dist` file, or a bad shebang, because unit tests import source
   rather than the package.
9. **Publish that tarball**, not the directory — `npm publish <tarball>
   --provenance` — so what ships is exactly what was smoke-tested.
10. **Confirm the registry serves it.** Poll `npm view`; publishes lag one to
    two minutes. Print `dist.integrity`.
11. **Verify the published artifact matches what was tested.** Download it
    back and diff its file list against the tarball packed at step 6 and
    tested at step 8 — *not* a re-run of step 7's rules, since two different
    compliant lists could both pass those. Skip, do not fail, if the registry
    has not replicated the tarball after retries: the publish already
    succeeded and was confirmed at step 10.
12. **Create the GitHub Release.** Mandatory. From the release notes if the
    repository has them, otherwise `gh release create --notes-from-tag`.

## `scripts/verify-tarball.mjs`

Each repository carries this script at the same path. It runs **two
independent checks** over `npm pack --dry-run --json`, because they catch
different mistakes:

**Allowlist** — every packed path must sit under `package.json` `files`. This
is mostly a formality, since `files` *is* an allowlist. It earns its keep on
npm's forced inclusions: the `bin` and `main` targets ship whether or not
`files` lists them, so a `bin` pointing outside `files` is the realistic
escape.

**Denylist** — no packed path may match `^src/`, `^test(s)/`,
`^node_modules/`, `^.github/`, any dotfile, or `.tsbuildinfo`. **This is the
check with teeth.** Widening `files` to `"src"` or `"."` passes the allowlist
by definition — the widened entry *is* the allowlist — and only a denylist
notices.

Anything deliberately shipped out of a denied tree goes in a named
`EXCEPTIONS` set, so the exception appears in review instead of hiding inside
a loosened pattern. An empty set is the expected state; each entry is a
standing decision somebody should be able to defend.

> **Repository-specific, tincan.** Exactly one exception:
> `test/fixtures/canonical-id.json`, which ships because consumers implement
> against it — see CANONICAL_ID.md. Another repository's set is its own
> business and belongs in its own copy of this file, not here.

> **A guard that has never been observed to fail is not a guard.** The
> allowlist-only version of this script was written first, and its negative
> test did not fire — removing an entry from `files` just stops packing the
> file, so there is no stray to find. Write the failing case and watch it fail
> before believing a check.

`ci.yml` runs the same script on every push, so tarball drift surfaces when it
is introduced rather than at release time.

## One-time setup, per package

Registering a trusted publisher **requires 2FA** — npm refuses the operation
to a token that bypasses it — so it cannot be scripted with a stored
credential. Do it once per package:

**Requires npm >= 12.** See the warning below — on npm 11 this fails with an
error that does not mention the npm version.

```bash
npm install -g npm@latest
npm login   # interactive, prompts for an OTP

# the environment must already exist on the GitHub side
gh api -X PUT repos/BrutalSystems/<repo>/environments/npm
```

**The package must already exist.** `npm trust` on a name the registry has
never seen answers `E404 ... Package not found`, so trust cannot be attached
before the first publish — and that first publish, coming from a human rather
than a workflow, has no provenance. Claim the name with a throwaway `0.0.0`
and let CI publish every version anyone installs. Publishing the real version
by hand also makes its release tag a green no-op, because the already-published
guard skips it and the GitHub Release step is gated behind the same condition.
Hit by tincan on 2026-09-20 and birddog on 2026-09-21; both times the failing
command was also mid-`npm login`, so unfinished auth may be the real cause —
publishing first works either way.

```bash
npm trust github @brutalsystems/<package> \
  --file publish.yml \
  --repo BrutalSystems/<repo> \
  --env npm \
  --allow-publish
```

Add required reviewers to that environment in the repository's **Settings →
Environments** if the publish set should be narrower than "anyone who can push
a tag".

The equivalent web route is the package's **Settings → Trusted Publisher →
GitHub Actions** on npmjs.com, with the same repository, workflow filename and
environment.

> **On npm 11.x this fails two different ways, and neither says "upgrade
> npm".** With `--allow-publish` you get `EUSAGE Unknown flag`, because the
> flag does not exist yet. Without it you get a bare `E400 Bad Request` with
> no explanation, because the registry requires a permissions field that npm
> 11 does not send. Same root cause, two unrelated-looking errors. `npm trust
> list <package>` is the useful diagnostic: if it answers, the credential is
> fine and the problem is the request, not the login.

## Releasing

1. Bump the version everywhere the repository keeps it. Prefer a test that
   asserts the copies agree, so a half-bump fails the build instead of
   shipping.
2. `npm run build && npm test`
3. Commit, tag `v<version>`, push both.
4. Watch the run: `gh run watch --repo BrutalSystems/<repo>`

Nothing else. The tag is the release trigger.
